# GUIGI - UNI-GUI
A test GUI for UNI-ICO from coded from Batch/Python. Codename: "GUIGI"
* INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
1. Place the GUIGI.bat files in the UNI-ICO Directory
2. Do NOT rename anything (obviously). It'll fuck stuff up.
3. Run from the icon that was just created on your desktop.
4. Report any bugs to me on Discord! 


* NOTES

1. This is for WINDOWS 10 ONLY. Yes, it may work on earlier versions of Win x86/x64, but I do not officially support it.
2. An exe version will be built sooner or later, after the code(s) for UNI-ICO, and the icon makers are perfected.

4. I do not own Gooigi (obviously). He's owned by Nintendo. All copyright belongs to Nintendo. I named it this because it started for a switch emulator (Yuzu) and evolved from there. Kinda like Gooiboi did from Weegee.
5. I make *absolutely* **zero** money from this. It's a project dedicated to the love of Video Games. Nothing more, nothing less. 
6. This code is in EARLY ACCESS, and comes with NO LISCENCE OR WARRANTY.

* FAQ

Q: Why does it come it a bat file?
A: Guigi is very directory dependant, and to negate this, it is hybrid code. It writes python a python script itself in same directory as the GUIGI.bat files.

Q: Will an EXE release ever come out?
A: Eventually. Defenitely not using BAT2EXE, because even with SHA's, it comes out as false positive.
