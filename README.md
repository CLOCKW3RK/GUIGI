# GUIGI - UNI-GUI
Test GUI for UNI-ICO from coded from VBS. (and soon Tkinter!) Codename: "GUIGI"
* INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
1. Place UNI-GUI and GUIGI-PRIMARY(Launch Me First!).bat in the UNI-ICO Directory
2. Do NOT rename anything (obviously). It'll fuck stuff up.
3. Run UNI-GUI.vbs that was just created. 


* NOTES
An exe version will be built sooner or later, after the code(s) for UNI-ICO, and the icon makers are perfected.
The exe will be built using BAT2EXE. Digital MD5 and SHA-1 sigs will be posted on this README when this occurs.

I do not own Gooigi (obviously). I named it this because it started for a switch emulator (Yuzu) and evolved from there.
Kinda like Gooiboi did from Weeg.
