# GUIGI - UNI-GUI
A test GUI for UNI-ICO from coded from Batch/Python. Codename: "GUIGI"
* INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
1. Place UNI-GUI.bat and GUIGI-PRIMARY(Launch Me First!).bat in the UNI-ICO Directory
2. Do NOT rename anything (obviously). It'll fuck stuff up.
3. Run UNI-GUI.vbs that was just created. 


* NOTES

1. This is for WINDOWS 10 ONLY. Yes, it may work on earlier versions of Win x86/x64, but I do not officially support it.
2. An exe version will be built sooner or later, after the code(s) for UNI-ICO, and the icon makers are perfected.

4. I do not own Gooigi (obviously). He's owned by Nintendo. All copyright belongs to Nintendo. I named it this because it started for a switch emulator (Yuzu) and evolved from there. Kinda like Gooiboi did from Weegee.
5. I make *absolutely* **zero** money from this. It's a project dedicated to the love of Video Games. Nothing more, nothing less. 
6. This code is in EARLY ACCESS, and comes with NO LISCENCE OR WARRANTY.

* FAQ

Q: Why does it come it a bat file?
A: Guigi is very directory dependant, and to negate this, it is hybrid code. It writes python a python script itself in same directory as the GUIGI.bat files.

Q: Will an EXE release ever come out?
A: Eventually. Defenitely not using BAT2EXE, because even with SHA's, it comes out as false positive.
