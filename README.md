# UNI-GUI
Test GUI for UNI-ICO from coded from VBS. (and soon Tkinter!) Codename: "Guigi"
* INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
1. Place UNI-GUI (FIRST LAUNCH).bat in the UNI-ICO Directory
2. Do NOT rename anything (obviously). It'll fuck stuff up.
3. Run UNI-GUI.vbs that was just created.


* NOTES
An exe version will be built sooner or later, after the code(s) for UNI-ICO, and the icon makers are perfected.
The exe will be built using BAT2EXE. Digital MD5 and SHA-1 sigs will be posted on this README when this occurs.
