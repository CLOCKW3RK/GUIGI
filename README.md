# GUIGI - UNI-GUI
- A GUI for UNI-ICO from coded from Batch/Python. Codename: "GUIGI" - Win 10

* INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

1. Install Python 3.8(3.9 works too)
2. Place the GUIGI.bat files in the UNI-ICO Directory (Found Here https://github.com/CLOCKW3RK/UNI-ICO)
3. Do NOT rename anything (obviously). It'll fuck stuff up.
4. Run from the icon that was just created on your desktop.
5. Report any bugs to me on Discord! 


* NOTES

1. This is for WINDOWS 10 ONLY. Yes, it may work on earlier versions of Win x86/x64, but I do not officially support it.
2. An exe version will be built sooner or later, after the code(s) for UNI-ICO, and the icon makers are perfected.

4. I do not own Gooigi (obviously). He's owned by Nintendo. All copyright belongs to Nintendo. I named it this because it started for a switch emulator (Yuzu) and evolved from there. Kinda like Gooiboi did from Weegee.
5. I make *absolutely* **zero** money from this. It's a project dedicated to the love of Video Games. Nothing more, nothing less. 
6. This code is in EARLY ACCESS, and comes with NO LISCENCE OR WARRANTY.

* FAQ

Q: Why does it come it a bat file?

A: Guigi is very directory dependant, and to negate this, it is hybrid code. It writes a python script in same directory as the GUIGI.bat files.

Q: Will an EXE release ever come out?

A: Eventually. Defenitely not using BAT2EXE, because even with SHA's, it comes out as false positive, not to mention, it just feels sloppy.

Q: Do you plan to merge this with UNI-ICO considering the "Legacy Mode" option?

A: Yes, but GUIGI will be the framework of *many* projects to come.

Q: Do you accept donations?

A: No, not currently. But soon I am getting Brave certified, and will accept **BAT Only** for donational causes. This FAQ will be updated if that happens.

Q: Is this safe?

A: You made it here and can read my words, right? Then you're probably competent enough to learn or have learned python, and decipher what the code does.
TL:DR; Yes, but I'm not responsible if anything goes arwy.
